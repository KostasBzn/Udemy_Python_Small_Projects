# Udemy Python Small Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects completed as part of the **"100 Days of Code: Python"** Udemy course. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates a specific concept or technique in Python.  

## Projects

### 1. **Quiz with object oriented programming**
   - A simple quiz application built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. This project demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and static methods to create an interactive quiz.

### 2. **Coffee Mashine**
   - A simple coffee machine simulator built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. This project demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and attributes to simulate a coffee-making process.

### 3. **Hirst Painting Project**
   - This Python script uses the `turtle` and `colorgram` libraries to generate a colorful dot painting based on colors extracted from an image.

### 3. **Turtle Race Python**
   - This Python script is a fun turtle race game where the user guesses which turtle will win the race!

### 4. **Snake Game üêç**
   - A simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the `turtle` module and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

### 5. **Pong Game**
   - A simple Pong game implemented in Python using the `turtle` module practicing with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
