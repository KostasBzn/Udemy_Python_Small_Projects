# Udemy Python Small Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects completed as part of the **"100 Days of Code: Python"** Udemy course. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates a specific concept or technique in Python.

## Projects

### 1. **Quiz with object oriented programming**

- A simple quiz application built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. This project demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and static methods to create an interactive quiz.

### 2. **Coffee Mashine**

- A simple coffee machine simulator built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. This project demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and attributes to simulate a coffee-making process.

### 3. **Turtle Race Python**

- This Python script is a fun turtle race game where the user guesses which turtle will win the race!

### 4. **Snake Game 🐍**

- A simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the `turtle` module and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

### 5. **Pong Game**

- A simple Pong game implemented in Python using the `turtle` module practicing with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

### 6. **Turtle Crossing Game 🐢**

- A fun and challenging Turtle Crossing game written in Python using the `turtle` module. Help the turtle cross the road safely while avoiding incoming cars and goo to the next level!

### 7. **U.S. States Game 🗺️**

- A fun and educational game to test your knowledge of U.S. states! Built using Python's `turtle` module and pandas.

### 8. **Pomodoro Timer**

- A simple **Pomodoro Timer** built using Python and Tkinter. This application helps users follow the **Pomodoro Technique**, a time management method that alternates focused work sessions with short breaks.

### 9. **My-Pass Password Manager**

- A simple and efficient password manager built using Python's `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface.

### 10. **FlashCard Project**

- A simple flashcard application built with `Python` and `Tkinter` to help you learn French words. The app displays a French word and its English translation after a few seconds. You can mark words as "learned," and they will be excluded from future sessions.

### 11. **Birthday Email Automation Project**

- This project automates sending birthday emails to recipients listed in a CSV file. It selects a random email template, personalizes it with the recipient's name, and sends the email on their birthday.

### 12. **Quizzer App**

- An improved version of my first Quiz App project, built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. This project demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and static methods to create an interactive quiz with GUI.

### 13. **Stock News Notifier**

- A simple Python automation script that monitors Tesla stock price (or any other stock you wish) using the Alpha Vantage API. If the stock price changes by 5% or more (either up or down) compared to the previous trading day, it sends an email alert with the latest relevant news headlines pulled from the NewsAPI.

### 14. **Stock News Notifier**

- A simple Python script that tracks workouts using the Nutritionix API and saves them to a Google Sheet via Sheety API.
