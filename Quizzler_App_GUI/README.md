# Quiz App

A simple quiz application built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. This project demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and static methods to create an interactive quiz.

## Features
- **OOP Design**: The project is structured using classes like `QuizBrain` and `Question` to manage the quiz logic and questions.
- **Dynamic Question Loading**: Questions are loaded from a list of dictionaries, making it easy to add or modify questions.
- **User Interaction**: The quiz prompts the user with True/False questions and provides immediate feedback on their answers.

## Questions Source
The questions used in this project were generated using the **Open Trivia Database** ([https://opentdb.com/](https://opentdb.com/)). The questions are stored in a list of dictionaries within the `data.py` file.

## How to Run
