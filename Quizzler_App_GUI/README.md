# Quizzer App

An improved version of my previous Quiz App, built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. This project demonstrates the use of classes, methods, and static methods to create an interactive quiz with GUI.

## Features
- **OOP Design**: The project is structured using classes like `QuizBrain` and `QuizInterface` to manage the quiz logic and user interface.
- **Dynamic Question Loading**: The questions used in this project were generated using the **Open Trivia Database**.
- **User Interaction**: The quiz prompts the user with True/False questions and provides immediate feedback on their answers.
- **Score Tracking**: The app keeps track of the user's score and displays it in real-time.
- **End of Quiz Handling**: The app gracefully handles the end of the quiz by disabling buttons and displaying a completion message.

## Questions Source
The questions used in this project were generated using the **Open Trivia Database** ([https://opentdb.com/](https://opentdb.com/)).
